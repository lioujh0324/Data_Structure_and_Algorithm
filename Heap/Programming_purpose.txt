This program was written to implement the heap structure in array.

The process of the program is as following :
    1. Users can input the elements in the heap by any order.
    2. The program will rearrange the order of the elements in the heap (in array type) once users finished a input of a node.
    3. The whole input process will not be terminated until users input an integer which <=0.
    4. The heap will be printed out in "level-order" (because a heap structure is just a complete binary tree).
    5. Then, program will let users to modify an arbitrary node.
    6. Finally, program will printed out the heap after changed (also in "level-order").
